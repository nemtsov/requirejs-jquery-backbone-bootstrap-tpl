RequireJS, jQuery, Bootstrap and Backbone Project Template
==========================================================

This is a simple project as that the RequireJS [optimization section](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html) 
describes.

Take a look at the [end result here](http://nemtsov.github.com/requirejs-jquery-backbone-bootstrap-tpl/).


## Instructions

Once you have the project cloned, you'll need to install "r.js" (the
executable which will build the project):

    npm install requirejs
    

open **lib/main.html** in the browser. Notice the number of 
CSS & JS files that it pulls **(8 in total)**. Then run: 

    make build

That will create a directory called **build/**. Open **build/main.html** in the browser.
You'll see that it will only pull **4 files**. That is because the build-step combines 
all CSS and JS into the fewest possible number of files.

## Testing

Do this once to get all of the testing dependencies:

    npm install

Run the following to test the project (testing is done via [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/)):

    make test


## More
